# Provider Management

Providers are the core feature of MobausStudio for connecting to AI services. Through provider management, you can easily connect to various AI services without manually configuring complex API settings.

## What is a Provider?

A provider is a source of AI services, such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc. Each provider offers different AI models. Once connected to a provider, you can use all models from that provider.
