# Provider Management

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD060 -->

Providers are the core feature of MobausStudio for connecting to AI services. Through provider management, you can easily connect to various AI services without manually configuring complex API settings.

## What is a Provider?

A provider is a source of AI services, such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc. Each provider offers different AI models. Once connected to a provider, you can use all models from that provider.

## Add Custom Provider

If you use an enterprise gateway, proxy service, or private deployment, you can add custom providers:

### When Do You Need a Custom Provider?

- Using an internal enterprise AI gateway
- Using a third-party proxy service
- Using a privately deployed OpenAI-compatible endpoint
- Using other OpenAI-compatible services not built-in

### How to Add a Custom Provider

1. Click the "🔌 Providers" icon in the sidebar
2. Click the "➕ Add Custom Provider" button in the top right
3. Fill in provider information:
   - **Name**: Custom name (e.g., "Company Internal AI")
   - **Icon**: Choose an emoji icon
   - **Description**: Brief description (supports both Chinese and English)
   - **API Endpoint**: Service address (e.g., `https://your-endpoint/v1`)
   - **API Key**: Fill in if required by your service (optional)
4. Add at least one model:
   - **Model ID**: Model identifier (e.g., `gpt-4o`)
   - **Display Name**: Name shown in the interface
   - **Max Output Tokens**: Maximum output length of the model
   - **Context Window**: Context length supported by the model
   - **Capabilities**: Check features supported by the model (vision, function calling, streaming)
5. Click "Test Connection" to verify the configuration
6. Click "Save" to complete

> 💡 **Tip**: You can add multiple custom providers, each with independent configuration and management.

### Managing Custom Providers

- **Edit**: Click the "Edit" button on the custom provider card to modify configuration
- **Delete**: Click the "Delete" button to remove the custom provider
