# Roundtable Meeting

Roundtable Meeting is a multi-agent collaboration feature that allows multiple AI agents to discuss the same topic together, providing multi-perspective analysis and suggestions.

## What is a Roundtable Meeting?

Imagine you have a team of experts, each with different professional backgrounds and perspectives. When facing a complex problem, you can bring them together for a discussion, with each expert contributing their insights from their own perspective.

Roundtable Meeting is exactly this concept - it lets multiple AI agents collaborate to discuss a topic, with each agent contributing based on their expertise.
